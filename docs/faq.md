## What is Beyond?

Beyond is a pioneering [native Bitcoin L1 bridge](https://app.beyond.tech) designed to provide the necessary infrastructure to enable thousands of Bitcoin-powered decentralized applications, by bringing the largest digital assets (such as USDT, ETH, and SOL — in addition to [BTC](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin) itself of course) into the Bitcoin network.

## Why Bitcoin? Why Beyond?

Bitcoin's unmatched decentralization, security, and global recognition have positioned it as the [leading driving force](https://coinmarketcap.com) of the entire blockchain industry for over a decade, with a market valuation over $1 Trillion USD at present. However, the lack of infrastructure to support a real on-chain economy has resulted in Bitcoin being [overshadowed by newer blockchains](https://defillama.com/chains) with advanced interoperability and Decentralized Finance (DeFi) capabilities — until now, that is, with significant game-changing breakthroughs having been achieved recently in 2024.

Within this context, Beyond exists to build a [multi-Trillion-dollar future](https://blockworks.co/news/bitcoin-defi-future) where Bitcoin becomes the powerhouse for DeFi on a global scale, evolving from just a store of value (_"digital gold"_) into a fully functional Bitcoin-powered on-chain economy.

## How is DeFi even possible on the Bitcoin L1?

With the introduction of [inscriptions](https://unchained.com/blog/bitcoin-inscriptions-ordinals) in 2023, we've seen a groundbreaking development that enables secure and unique identification and use of digital assets (such as tokens and NFTs) on the Bitcoin network. This breakthrough marked the beginning of a new era for digital asset innovation, leveraging Bitcoin’s unparalleled reliability and security infrastructure to improve the global economy.

## What are Inscriptions and Ordinals?

- **Inscriptions**: Imagine you could take a tiny piece of Bitcoin — not just any piece, but a very specific one — and mark it with a digital sticker. These stickers could be anything: a picture, a piece of text, a snippet of a song, or even a small program. This is exactly what inscriptions allow you to do. They let users attach a wide array of digital information directly onto Bitcoin’s smallest units, called [satoshis](https://investopedia.com/terms/s/satoshi.asp), similar to how you might stick a unique label onto individual pages of a book.

- **Ordinals**: And how do we make sure each of these "book pages" are unique? This is where [ordinals](https://unchained.com/blog/bitcoin-inscriptions-ordinals) come into play. Ordinals are like giving every single satoshi, or book page, a serial number. Just like how every dollar bill has a unique number, every satoshi gets its own identifier, making it distinguishable from all others no matter who they belong to. This numbering system makes it possible to track, trade, and collect any satoshi, especially those with special stickers (inscriptions) attached to them.

:::note Why are inscriptions and Ordinals so important?

Ordinals allow us to identify and track each satoshi, while inscriptions let us attach meaningful data to them. Together, they transform these satoshis from mere fractions of a Bitcoin into unique, programmable digital artifacts. This novel use introduces a whole new dimension to the Bitcoin network, leveraging its security and decentralization to support a flourishing ecosystem without altering Bitcoin’s foundational principles.
