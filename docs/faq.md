## What is Beyond?

[Beyond](https://beyond.tech is the leading native Bitcoin L1 bridge, built and designed to provide the necessary infrastructure to give rise to thousands of decentralized applications inside the Bitcoin network.

## Our Vision?

Bitcoin's unmatched decentralization and global recognition have positioned it as the [cornerstone of all blockchains](https://coinmarketcap.com. However, the [lack of leading-edge native bitcoin bridging solutions](https://defillama.com/bridges) has led to a widening gap, resulting in Bitcoin's disassociation from DeFi. Consequently, Bitcoin has been overshadowed by the rapid evolution of DeFi ecosystems and their shift towards omnichain interoperability and multichain dynamics.

In the mission of spearheading [Bitcoin's next era](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_bitcoin), Beyond, in partnership with renowned allies, is dedicated to reinstating Bitcoin at the forefront of blockchain innovation and navigating towards a [multi-Trillion-dollar DeFi future](https://blockworks.co/news/bitcoin-defi-future) by leveraging battle-tested bridging technology — secured by the most reputable cybersecurity firms — thus establishing Bitcoin as the premier layer-1 for decentralized finance.

## DeFi on Bitcoin L1?

Indeed. With the dawn of [inscriptions](https://unchained.com/blog/bitcoin-inscriptions-ordinals in December 2022, Bitcoin transcended its role as digital gold. This breakthrough allows for the secure and unique identification of digital assets on the Bitcoin network, heralding a new age of digital asset interaction and creativity within Bitcoin’s robust security framework.

## What are Inscriptions and Ordinals?

- Inscriptions: Imagine you could take a tiny piece of Bitcoin, not just any piece, but a very specific one, and mark it with a digital sticker. These stickers could be anything: a picture, a piece of text, a snippet of a song, or even a small program. This is exactly what inscriptions allow you to do. They let users attach a wide array of digital information directly onto Bitcoin’s smallest units, called [satoshis](https://investopedia.com/terms/s/satoshi.asp), similar to how you might stick a unique label onto individual grains of sand.

- Ordinals: But how do we make sure each of these "grains of sand" is unique? This is where [ordinals](https://unchained.com/blog/bitcoin-inscriptions-ordinals) come into play. Ordinals are like giving every single satoshi, or grain, a serial number. Just like how every dollar bill has a unique number, every satoshi gets its own identifier, making it distinguishable from all others. This numbering system makes it possible to track, trade, and collect these satoshis, especially those with special stickers (inscriptions) attached to them.

:::info Why are inscriptions and Ordinals so simple but yet profound?

Ordinals allow us to identify and track each satoshi, while inscriptions let us attach meaningful data to them. Together, they transform these satoshis from mere fractions of a Bitcoin into unique digital artifacts or collectibles, much like how a physical coin can be minted with a special design to commemorate an event. This novel use of Bitcoin’s infrastructure introduced a whole new dimension to the network, leveraging its security and decentralization to support a burgeoning ecosystem of digital ownership and creativity, without altering Bitcoin’s foundational principles.
