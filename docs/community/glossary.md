# Glossary

Here we include an index of terms commonly used around the Beyond ecosystem, listed in alphabetical order. For more general terminology, we can also suggest [CoinMarketCap's crypto glossary](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary).

## APR

Annual Percentage Rate (APR) denotes the yearly interest rate without compounding effects. Example: A \$100 investment at a 5% APR yields \$105 after one year.

## APY

Annual Percentage Yield (APY), akin to [APR](/onboarding/glossary#apr) but incorporates compounding, thereby increasing the yield over time due to the interest itself earning additional interest.

## Blockchain

Blockchains are systems that record transactions across multiple computers in a way that ensures security, transparency, and immutability. Each record, or 'block', is linked to the previous one, forming a chain. This architecture allows for decentralized data management and verification, serving as the foundation for cryptocurrencies and a wide range of applications.

## Bridge

Bridges refer to technology that enables the transfer of assets and information between two distinct blockchain ecosystems. It facilitates interoperability and liquidity across different networks, allowing users to seamlessly access and leverage the unique advantages of each system.

## Cryptocurrency

Cryptocurrencies, also known as 'tokens', are a digital or virtual form of currency that uses cryptography for security and operates on a decentralized network, typically a blockchain. Unlike traditional currencies, cryptocurrencies are distinguished by their lack of physical form and decentralized nature, facilitating peer-to-peer transactions without the need for intermediaries or a central human authority.


## dApp

Decentralized Applications (dApps) are software applications that operate without central authority control, in a fully feature-complete manner.

## DeFi

Decentralized Finance (DeFi) encompasses various types of financial applications developed on blockchain networks, offering open, decentralized alternatives to conventional financial services through [smart contracts](#smart-contracts).

## DEX

Decentralized Exchanges (DEX) are blockchain-based exchanges facilitating peer-to-peer asset transactions without central oversight, using algorithms and liquidity pools for pricing, thus enabling direct asset control and custody by users.

## DLT

Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) is the foundational technology for blockchain and DAG networks, featuring a database distributed across multiple sites, regions, or participants.

## Governance

Governance in the blockchain context refers to the mechanisms and processes through which decisions are made within a decentralized network or protocol. It typically involves token holders voting on proposals related to protocol updates, improvements, and the direction of the project, ensuring a democratic and transparent approach to development and management.

## Liquidity

Liquidity refers to the ease with which an asset can be converted into another asset — or cash — without significantly affecting its price. High liquidity is associated with a stable and healthy financial ecosystem, as it facilitates smoother transactions and more accurate price discovery.

## Oracles

Off-chain data feeds that supply real-world information to blockchain smart contracts, enabling interactions with external data.

## Permissionless

Describes systems or frameworks where access or participation is not controlled by any single entity, allowing for use without a central authority that can arbitrarily regulate who or how the system can be used.

## Smart Contracts

Smart Contracts are self-executing contracts with the terms directly written into code. They automatically enforce and execute the terms of agreement between parties, pivotal for automating decentralized applications and transactions.

## Staking

Staking involves depositing tokens into a protocol to support network security and operations, often [yielding rewards](#yield-rewards) or [governance privileges](#governance) in return.

## Swap

Swapping enables direct cryptocurrency exchanges without intermediaries, typically executed on [Bridges](#bridge) or [DEXs](#dex) through algorithmically determined rates.

## Total Value Locked (TVL)

Total Value Locked (TVL) measures the cumulative value of assets deposited in a [DeFi](#defi) protocol, indicating its usage and liquidity.

## Yield Rewards

Yield Rewards refer to the earnings generated from various [DeFi](#defi) activities, such as staking, providing liquidity, or participating in yield farming. These rewards, often distributed in the form of tokens, incentivize users to contribute to the ecosystem's security, liquidity, and overall growth.
