## Going ₿eyond `Digital Gold`

Bitcoin's unmatched decentralization and global recognition have positioned it as the [cornerstone of all blockchains](https://coinmarketcap.com/). However, the [lack of leading-edge native bitcoin bridging solutions](https://defillama.com/bridges) has led to a widening gap, resulting in Bitcoin's disassociation from DeFi. Consequently, Bitcoin has been overshadowed by the rapid evolution of DeFi ecosystems and their shift towards omnichain interoperability and multichain dynamics.

In the mission of spearheading [Bitcoin's next era](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_bitcoin), ₿eyond, in partnership with renowned allies, is dedicated to reinstating Bitcoin at the forefront of blockchain innovation and navigating towards a [multi-Trillion-dollar DeFi future](https://blockworks.co/news/bitcoin-defi-future) by leveraging battle-tested bridging technology — secured by the most reputable cybersecurity firms — thus establishing Bitcoin as the premier layer-1 for decentralized finance.

## Spearheading towards ₿eyond `V2`

Our journey with ₿eyond is only getting started. With a seasoned team continuously pushing the boundaries of cryptography, cybersecurity, and web3 innovations, ₿eyond V2 is poised to introduce groundbreaking opportunities — marking our unwavering commitment alongside our partners to not only lead but [redefine the future of Bitcoin](https://www.ignasdefi.com/p/ordinals-and-btc-defi-start-here).
