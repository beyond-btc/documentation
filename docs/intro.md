# Welcome to ₿eyond

> _Enabling the Bitcoin On-Chain Economy._

[Beyond](https://beyond.tech) is a pioneering [native Bitcoin L1 bridge](https://app.beyond.tech), built and designed to provide the necessary infrastructure to enable thousands of decentralized applications *inside* the Bitcoin network.

Beyond prioritizes security to bring the largest digital assets (such as USDT, ETH or SOL) into [Bitcoin](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf) itself — the world's most decentralized and secure blockchain, boasting an untapped [+$1.4 Trillion (with T) USD market valuation](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin) where economic activity *on* the network itself represents [only 0.2% of the total value](https://defillama.com/chain/Bitcoin) at present.

## Going ₿eyond `Digital Gold`

Bitcoin's unparalleled decentralization and global recognition have positioned it as the [leading driving force](https://coinmarketcap.com) of the entire blockchain industry for over a decade. However, the lack of infrastructure to support a real on-chain economy has resulted in Bitcoin being [overshadowed by newer blockchains](https://defillama.com/chains) with advanced interoperability and Decentralized Finance (DeFi) capabilities — until now, that is, with significant game-changing breakthroughs having been achieved recently in 2024.

Beyond exists to build a [multi-Trillion-dollar future](https://blockworks.co/news/bitcoin-defi-future) where Bitcoin becomes the powerhouse for DeFi on a global scale. Our team and community are _beyond_ excited to play a crucial role in enabling this evolution from just a store of value (_"digital gold"_), to a fully functional Bitcoin-powered on-chain economy.
