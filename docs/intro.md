## Going ₿eyond Digital Gold

Bitcoin's unmatched decentralization and global recognition have positioned it as the [cornerstone of all blockchains](https://coinmarketcap.com/). However, the [lack of leading-edge native bitcoin bridging solutions](https://defillama.com/bridges) has led to a widening gap, resulting in Bitcoin's disassociation from DeFi. Consequently, Bitcoin has been overshadowed by the rapid evolution of DeFi ecosystems and their shift towards omnichain interoperability and multichain dynamics.
