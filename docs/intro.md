[₿eyond](https://beyond.tech) is the leading [native Bitcoin L1 bridge](https://app.beyond.tech), built and designed to provide the necessary infrastructure to give rise to thousands of decentralized applications *inside* the Bitcoin network.

The protocol prioritizes security to bring the largest digital assets (such as USDT, ETH or SOL) into [Bitcoin](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf) itself — the world's most decentralized and secure blockchain, boasting a largely untapped [+$1.4 Trillion (with T) USD market valuation](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin), where economic activity *on* the network itself represents only [~0.2% of the total value](https://defillama.com/chain/Bitcoin) at the present time.

## Going ₿eyond `Digital Gold`

Bitcoin's unmatched decentralization and global recognition have positioned it as the [cornerstone of all blockchains](https://coinmarketcap.com/). However, the [lack of leading-edge native bitcoin bridging solutions](https://defillama.com/bridges) has led to a widening gap, resulting in Bitcoin's disassociation from DeFi. Consequently, Bitcoin has been overshadowed by the rapid evolution of DeFi ecosystems and their shift towards omnichain interoperability and multichain dynamics.

In the mission of spearheading [Bitcoin's next era](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_bitcoin), ₿eyond, in partnership with renowned allies, is dedicated to reinstating Bitcoin at the forefront of blockchain innovation and navigating towards a [multi-Trillion-dollar DeFi future](https://blockworks.co/news/bitcoin-defi-future) by leveraging battle-tested bridging technology — secured by the most reputable cybersecurity firms — thus establishing Bitcoin as the premier layer-1 for decentralized finance.
