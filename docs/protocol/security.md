## Smart Contracts

Beyond utilizes smart contracts to implement the logic and rules for cross-chain token transfers. 

## Multi-Signature Mechanism

To ensure the security of cross-chain transfers, Beyond employs a multi-signature ('multisig') mechanism. When a user initiates a token transfer request, multiple authorized signatures are required to execute the cross-chain operation, mitigating potential malicious behavior and risks.

## Listening Nodes

Beyond relies on listening nodes to monitor transaction statuses on the ETH chain, BNB chain, and BTC network. These nodes are responsible for monitoring token locking and release events, ensuring real-time and accurate cross-chain transfers.

## Security Audits

To ensure the security of cross-chain transfers, Beyond conducts regular security audits. By reviewing smart contracts, system architecture, and relevant code, the system is checked for potential vulnerabilities and security risks.
