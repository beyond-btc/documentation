# Security

Beyond implements comprehensive, thorough security measures at every step.

Security is a top priority, with a variety of measures in place to ensure the safety and integrity of cross-chain transactions. These measures are designed to protect user assets, maintain service reliability, and mitigate potential risks. In this article we list the key security features and practices employed.

### 1. Encryption

Use strong encryption standards for data at rest and in transit, leveraging protocols like TLS and AES encryption algorithms.

### 2. Key Management with MPC and TSS

Augment traditional key management approaches with Multi-Party Computation (MPC) and Threshold Signing Schemes (TSS). This decentralized approach to key management involves splitting private keys into multiple shares via a multi-signature ('multisig') mechanism, with a transaction requiring a minimum threshold of these shares to be signed.

This approach not only enhances security by distributing trust but also adds resilience against key theft or loss. By integrating MPC and TSS into the key management strategy, control over cryptographic operations is decentralized, thereby reducing single points of failure and enhancing the overall security posture.

### 3. Access Controls

Implement strict access control measures, employing the principle of least privilege across all system and user interactions.

### 4. Secure APIs

Secure all application programming interfaces (APIs), particularly those interfacing with blockchain networks, with measures like authentication, rate limiting, and input validation.

### 5. Smart Contract Security

Ensure that smart contracts used for operations such as token locking, minting, or burning are thoroughly audited and free from exploit vulnerabilities.

### 6. Node Security

Harden the security of blockchain nodes interacting with the application, through firewalls, updated software, and vigilant monitoring.

### 7. Intrusion Detection and Prevention

Utilize IDS and IPS systems to monitor for and mitigate malicious activities and potential security breaches.

### 8. DDoS Protection

Implement measures to protect against Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, safeguarding both the application and associated blockchain nodes.

### 9. Secure Development Practices

Adhere to secure coding practices, conduct regular code reviews, and use security-focused development frameworks.

### 10. Logging and Monitoring

Maintain robust logging and monitoring systems to track transactions, access, and changes, ensuring logs are immutable and securely stored.

### 11. Incident Response Plan

Develop a comprehensive incident response plan, outlining procedures for managing security incidents, communication protocols, and recovery processes.

### 12. Continuous Security Assessment and Penetration Testing

Regularly conduct security assessments and penetration testing to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities within the application and infrastructure. This includes:
    - **Automated Security Scanning**: Use automated tools to continuously scan the codebase, dependencies, and infrastructure for known vulnerabilities and configuration issues. Tools like static application security testing (SAST) and dynamic application security testing (DAST) are particularly effective.
    - **Manual Penetration Testing**: Engage cybersecurity experts to perform manual penetration testing (pentesting) to simulate real-world attacks and discover vulnerabilities that automated tools might miss.
    - **Blockchain-specific Assessments**: Include examinations that focus on blockchain-specific vulnerabilities, such as smart contract flaws, consensus algorithm weaknesses, and node communication security.
    - **Third-Party Audits**: Regularly have third-party security firms audit the application and its infrastructure to provide an external perspective with new insights and identify potential security gaps.

<!-- ### 13. Compliance and Legal

Ensure the protocol complies with relevant legal and regulatory standards, considering both data protection and cryptocurrency-specific regulations. -->
