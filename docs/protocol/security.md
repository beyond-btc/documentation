# Security

Beyond's security measures are thorough and uncompromising at every step.

> TODO: two sections below

1. Encryption: Use strong encryption standards for data at rest and in transit, leveraging protocols like TLS and AES encryption algorithms.
2.  Access Controls: Implement strict access control measures, employing the principle of least privilege across all system and user interactions.
3.  Key Management with MPC and TSS: Augment traditional key management approaches with Multi-Party Computation (MPC) and Threshold Signing Schemes (TSS). This decentralized approach to key management involves splitting private keys into multiple shares, with a transaction requiring a minimum threshold of these shares to be signed. This not only enhances security by distributing trust but also adds resilience against key theft or loss.
4.  Secure APIs: Secure all application programming interfaces (APIs), particularly those interfacing with blockchain networks, with measures like authentication, rate limiting, and input validation.
5.  Smart Contract Security: Ensure that smart contracts used for operations such as token minting or burning are thoroughly audited and free from common vulnerabilities.
6.  Node Security: Harden the security of blockchain nodes our application interacts with, through firewalls, updated software, and vigilant monitoring.
7.  Intrusion Detection and Prevention: Utilize IDS and IPS systems to monitor for and mitigate malicious activities and potential security breaches.
8.  DDoS Protection: Implement measures to protect against Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, safeguarding both our application and associated blockchain nodes.
9.  Secure Development Practices: Adhere to secure coding practices, conduct regular code reviews, and use security-focused development frameworks.
10. Logging and Monitoring: Maintain robust logging and monitoring systems to track transactions, access, and changes, ensuring logs are immutable and securely stored.
11. Incident Response Plan: Develop a comprehensive incident response plan, outlining procedures for managing security incidents, communication protocols, and recovery processes.
12. Continuous Security Assessment and Penetration Testing: Regularly conduct security assessments and penetration testing to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities within our application and infrastructure. This should include:
- Automated Security Scanning: Use automated tools to continuously scan our codebase, dependencies, and infrastructure for known vulnerabilities and configuration issues. Tools like static application security testing (SAST) and dynamic application security testing (DAST) can be particularly effective.
- Manual Penetration Testing: Engage with cybersecurity experts to perform manual penetration testing. This involves simulating real-world attacks to discover new vulnerabilities that automated tools might miss, particularly in complex systems like blockchain applications.
- Blockchain-specific Assessments: Given the unique nature of blockchain technology, include assessments that focus on blockchain-specific vulnerabilities, such as smart contract flaws, consensus algorithm weaknesses, and node communication security.
- Third-Party Audits: Regularly have third-party security firms audit our application and its infrastructure. An external perspective can provide new insights and identify potential security gaps that internal teams might overlook.
- This practice ensures that security is an ongoing process rather than a one-time setup, allowing you to adapt to new threats and vulnerabilities as they arise. Continuous assessment, combined with a proactive security posture, can significantly reduce the risk of successful cyber attacks and the potential impact on our application and users.
13. Compliance and Legal: Ensure our application complies with relevant legal and regulatory standards, considering both data protection and cryptocurrency-specific regulations.

By integrating MPC and TSS into our key management strategy, we decentralize the control over cryptographic operations, thereby reducing single points of failure and enhancing the overall security posture of our blockchain bridge application. This approach is particularly beneficial in environments where trust must be distributed among multiple parties or where the risk of key compromise must be minimized.

> Security is a top priority for Beyond. We implement a variety of security measures to ensure the safety and integrity of cross-chain transactions. Our protocol is designed to protect user assets and data, prevent unauthorized access, exploits, and mitigate potential risks. Below are some of the key security features and practices that we employ:_
- A
- B
- C
- Waiting a minimum of 6 blocks confirmations before considering transaction as confirmed, to ensure absolute success rate while balancing security with user experience.
- Z

> TODO: the content below is not ours, just there to showcase some categories that we may include in this article

## Smart Contracts

Beyond utilizes smart contracts to implement the logic and rules for cross-chain token transfers. 

## Multi-Signature Mechanism

To ensure the security of cross-chain transfers, Beyond employs a multi-signature ('multisig') mechanism. When a user initiates a token transfer request, multiple authorized signatures are required to execute the cross-chain operation, mitigating potential malicious behavior and risks.

## Listening Nodes

Beyond relies on listening nodes to monitor transaction statuses on the ETH chain, BNB chain, and BTC network. These nodes are responsible for monitoring token locking and release events, ensuring real-time and accurate cross-chain transfers.

## Security Audits

To ensure the security of cross-chain transfers, Beyond conducts regular security audits. By reviewing smart contracts, system architecture, and relevant code, the system is checked for potential vulnerabilities and security risks.
