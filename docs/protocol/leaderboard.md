# The Leaderboard

Beyond is set to introduce a native token as we progress towards full decentralization and utility. Around the Token Generation Event (TGE), we will launch the `Leaderboard`, an open program that celebrates and rewards Beyond's most active users via community airdrops.

Currently, the team's focus remains on perfecting the core product to ensure the best possible quality before introducing the token and the accompanying community airdrops. Details regarding the Leaderboard have not yet been announced, but we'll hint at this: your total volume on Beyond directly influences your position on the Leaderboard.

Stay tuned to [our social channels](/community/socials) for the latest updates around the official Leaderboard launch!

<!-- > _TODO: biz devs_

Introduce the Airdrop+Referral Program here, mention it works in seasons, with X (3?) seasons per year.

## How to Climb the Leaderboard

There are 3 ways to earn points. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.

### Use Beyond

Use Beyond, the more volume you bridge, the higher you climb

### Invite Friends

Use the referral link to invite new users

### Boost with BYD

MAYBE: hold $BYD tokens to multiply your points - the more you hold, the higher the multiplier, it works in tiers -->
