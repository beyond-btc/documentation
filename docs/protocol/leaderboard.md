# Airdrop Program

Beyond will have a native token with various utilities. Around the same time of the Token Generation Event (TGE), we will launch the Beyond Leaderboard, a gamified Airdrop Program that rewards the most active users.

For the time being, we would like to focus on building the best possible product before launching the token, and with it, the community airdrops. The specific info around the Leaderboard will remain a mystery for now, but we will mention: the more volume you bridge through Beyond, the higher you will climb it.

We will keep you updated on the latest progress on [our socials](/community/socials.md)!

<!-- > _TODO: biz devs_

Introduce the Airdrop+Referral Program here, mention it works in seasons, with X (3?) seasons per year.

## How to Climb the Leaderboard

There are 3 ways to earn points. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.

### Use Beyond

Use Beyond, the more volume you bridge, the higher you climb

### Invite Friends

Use the referral link to invite new users

### Boost with BYD

MAYBE: hold $BYD tokens to multiply your points - the more you hold, the higher the multiplier, it works in tiers -->
